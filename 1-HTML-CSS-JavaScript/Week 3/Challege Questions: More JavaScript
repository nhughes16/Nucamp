1. let sqrt=Math.sqrt(144);

2. This will return a value of true. I beleive JavaScript will automatically do a type conversion if the character '5' to a number to accurately compare the two.

    this can be tested by creating a button to call a fuction

    <button type="button" onclick="test()">Test</button>

    <script>
        function test(){
            let value = '5' > 3;
            alert(value);
        }
    </script>

3. the += assignment operation can be used with strings. It will add more text onto the end of an existing string.

    function test2(){
        let string1 = "some BS";
        string1 += ", some more BS";
        alert(string1);
    }

    the final value of string1 would be "some BS, some more BS"

4. function test3(){
        let num1 = 365;
        let string1 = "";
        string1 = num1.toString();

        let string2 = "Number of Days in the year: ";
        string2 += num1;
    }

5. When script is placed in the head of an element any scripts that would run to change the website in any way will happen before the page loads. This can, and most likely will cause a page to feel like it loads slower. (this wont be nearly as noticeable on a small page, but as pages get larger and more complex this can cause issues).

6. //this is a single comment line

    /* this is a block of comment 
        it can take up multiple lines */

7. let lastIndex = testArray.lastIndexOf("test");

    This will search 'testArray' for the word 'test', and return the index (position) of the last time the word 'test' appears in that array.

    example:

    testArray = ["sample", "like", "words", "test", "other", "marbles", "test", "more"];
                    0         1       2        3       4         5         6       7

    it would return the number 6. Because the last time the word 'test' appears in that array is at index 6

8. NaN (not a number) will check a variable to determine if that variable is or is not a number. it is jused like a function, and will return a boolean value.

    let isNum = isNaN(number1);

    the value of isNum will be either true or false. If the value of number1 is a number, isNum will be true.
