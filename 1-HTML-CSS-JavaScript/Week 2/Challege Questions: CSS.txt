Question 1:
    you can use rgb or hsl
    background-color: rbg(255,125,0);
    background-color: hsl(255, 60%, 50%);

Question 2:
    #fff is correct because it is the same as saying #ffffff, it is just shorted to use only the first digit of each 2 digit code.
    #ffffff44 is correct because #ffffff is the color (white) and 44 sets the transperancy of that color

Question 3:
    1st: top
    2nd: right & left
    3rd: bottom

Question 4:
    em and rem are relative sizes. 2em would be 2 times the size the of the current element size. em is stackable and multiples size within stacked elements
    rem is very similar to em however, it is relative to the root element and thus will not stack (or multiply each time it is stacked)

Question 5:
    list-style can be broken into 3 things

    list-style-image
    list-style-postion: being inside or outside (this affect where subsequent line of text align, either under the other text (outside) or under the bullet point (inside))
    list-style-type: being the shape of the bullet point

    or writen short hand with all 3 into list-style:

    ul{
        list-style: 
    }

Question 6:
    pseudo-elements have a sytax of element::psuedo-element

    one example of this is:
    
    p::first-letter{

    }

    This would apply specific css to the first leter of a paragraph.

Question 7:
    The !important rule in CSS means that any subsequent rules for that item will be ignored. This should be avoided because it essentially contradicts the fact that CSS is cascading.
